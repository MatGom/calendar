# Calendar Planner App

## Overview

This calendar app enables users to plan their activities or write down notes for various events while providing weather updates for their local area. It was developed using React for its core functionality and plain CSS for its styling.

## About This Project

I personally developed this project from scratch. It utilizes `useState` for managing local state and `React Context` for overseeing global state. The interface is enhanced with free icons from Font Awesome, making the app more intuitive and visually appealing. Weather updates are powered by the OpenWeather API, delivering accurate current weather conditions directly to the user.

## Features

- **Planning and Notes**: Easily add plans or notes directly on the calendar for any day of the month.
- **Weather Information**: Stay updated with the latest weather information for your current location.
- **User-Friendly**: With straightforward navigation and clear icons from Font Awesome, the app is designed for ease of use.
- **Responsive Design**: Crafted with CSS, the app offers a smooth experience across various devices, including phones and computers.
